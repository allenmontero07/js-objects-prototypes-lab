# CMPS2212 – Lab 1: Functions, Objects, and Prototypes

This lab focuses on practicing core JavaScript concepts such as function declarations, arrow functions, object literals, and prototype-based inheritance.
It includes multiple exercises that demonstrate how objects work, how methods are inherited, and how to use Object.create() to build prototype chains.
